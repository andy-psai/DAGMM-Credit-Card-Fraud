# DAGMM-Credit-Card-Fraud
Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model

My implementation of the ICLR 2018 paper: http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~bzong/doc/iclr18-dagmm.pdf

Includes hyperparmeter optimization routine and uses the Kaggle creidt card fraud dataset as an example (this is not a challenging dataset but there are not so many comparable datasets pubilcly available).  This implementation was able to reproduce the F1-score results from the above paper on the KDDCUP99 cyber dataset.
